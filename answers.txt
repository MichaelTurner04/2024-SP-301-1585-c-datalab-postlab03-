1. running ls -al * showed me all the files in my current directory along with their size and permisions. running ls -al .* seems to show me the git configs/files in this folder. You shouldn't run rm -rm .* because it will delete all files in the directory, and since linux has no recycling bin like windows, they will immediately be lost forever.
2. "ls -t" will sort a listing by file modification time. cat -n will show line numbers when outputting a file. "whatis" will provide a short summary of the specified command used with it.
