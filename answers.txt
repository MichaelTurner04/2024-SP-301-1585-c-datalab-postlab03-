1. running ls -al * showed me all the files in my current directory along with their size and permisions. running ls -al .* seems to show me the git configs/files in this folder. You shouldn't run rm -rm .* because it will delete all files in the directory, and since linux has no recycling bin like windows, they will immediately be lost forever.
2. "ls -t" will sort a listing by file modification time. cat -n will show line numbers when outputting a file. "whatis" will provide a short summary of the specified command used with it.
3. file.txt contains the word apple. file.txt contains the word banana. I can conclude that the ">" symbol will create a file specified to the right hand side containing what is givin on the left hand side. The ">>" operator adds a new line in the already made file instead of removing the old text in the file. "wc" shows the amount of lines, then the amount of words, then the amount of characters.
